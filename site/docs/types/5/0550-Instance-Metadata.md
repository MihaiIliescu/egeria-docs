# 0550 Instance Metadata

The *InstanceMetadata* classification is used to show that a data field represented by the [SchemaElement](/types/5/0501-Schema-Elements) contains metadata (rather than business data).  This is needed when each record/instance/row/object in the data needs a different metadata classification.
