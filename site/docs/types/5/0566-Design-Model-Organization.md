# 0566 Design Model Organization

In this model we define the top-level *Design Model* that is the anchor for a collection of related [DesignModelElements](/types/5/0565-Design-Model-Elements).

Design models can get quite large, so it helps the software architects and developers to be able to organize the content of the models into related groups.  These groups can themselves be organized into a hierarchy.
