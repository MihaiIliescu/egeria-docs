     * [Planning Runtime](/guides/planning/runtime/overview) describes how to plan your Open Metadata and Governance (OMAG) platforms and servers.
     * Planning User Interfaces describes how to plan for the two user interfaces that Egeria supplies.

         * General UI: TBA
         * [Ecosystem UI](/user-interfaces/ecosystem/ecosystem-ui-planning)
      
* *Preparing Metadata Ecosystem* describes the types of metadata that should be populated in your open metadata ecosystem to allow it to operate effectively.

    * [Metadata Valid Values](/guides/planning/valid-values/overview) to control the values used in open metadata elements.
