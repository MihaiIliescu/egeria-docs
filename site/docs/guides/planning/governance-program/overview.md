# Setting up your Governance Program

An organization's governance program described the cross-cutting initiatives that ensure the organization is operating efficiently and ethically with the most optimal use of resources.  Egeria supports open metadata definitions that aid the management and exchange of information that drives the governance program.

The governance program is divided into governance domains.

## Governance domains

Governance domains are the areas of an organization's operation that need a specific governance focus.  For example, a governance domain may be driving a transformation strategy, planning support for a regulation, driving an efficiency campaign or developing an assurance program for your organization.

A governance domain typically involves the ongoing cooperation of multiple teams from different business areas.  There is often a [business strategy](#governance-definitions) and a [set of targets](#measures-and-metrics) associated with the domain since its purpose is to provide some level of improvement or benefit to the organization.

Each domain is typically the responsibility of a different executive in the organization.  Different domains may use slightly different terminology and often run different tools but in fact they are very similar in the way that they operate.  Egeria allows the teams from the different governance domains to collaborate and benefit from each other's efforts.

??? info "Examples of governance domains"
    The governance domains can vary in scope and importance to the business.  In the example below, *Corporate Governance* ensures that the business operates legally. It is the key focus of the board or directors and includes financial reporting.  

    At the heart of the organization's operation are three governance domains that are often run separately, but in fact are highly dependent on one another:

    * *Data (or Information) Governance* focuses on the appropriate use and management of data.
    * *Information Security (InfoSec)* focuses on the security of the IT Systems (and sometimes the physical security of buildings and plant).
    * *IT Infrastructure* ensures systems are correctly set up and managed.so they deliver the level of service required by the business.  This governance domain often uses a taylored version of IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL).

    Software development needs governance to ensure it is properly designed, built and tested - and fit of purpose.  This governance is typically guided by a software development method, such as *Agile Development* and covers all aspects of the software development lifecycle.

    There are other domains that are more specialized.  For example:

    * *Privacy* focusses on compliance with data subject privacy.  It interacts with the data governance, software development lifecycle and IT Infrastrcuture domains.
    * *Human Capital Management* combines Human Resources (HR) and the management team of the organization to ensure the people they employ receive the training and support to build the right skills to support the business.
    * *Risk Management* assesses and, where necessary mittigates against the risks that may impact the organization.  It is often lead by the finance team because the level of risk can affect their credit rating.  However in some industries, such as banking, where the reporting and management of risk is covered by specific regulations, there is a separate organization that interfaces with the regulators.
    * *Physical Asset Management* manages the physical buildings, furnature, machinery, computers etc that the organization owns.  It is responsible for maintenance and replacement of these items.
    * *Product Assurance* ensures the products that the organization sells meet regulatory requirements and match the ethos of the organization.
    * *Procurement* focussed on the policies and rules assicuated with the products and services bought by people across the organization.  There may be a seprate procurement team that interacts with suppliers to ensure bulk discounts and quality.  They would work with other leaders in the organization to ensure the approach matches the needs of the business.
    * *Sustainability* is a relatively new governance domain that focuses on the effective use of resources to improve long-term sustainability of the organization's operations.

Governance domains are represented by [*Governance Domain Descriptions*](/types/4/0401-Governance-Definitions).  These definitions include the *domainIdentifier* property, a *displayName* and a *description*.   The *domainIdentifier* property is an integer and by convention "0" means "applies to all domains".  For example:

This includes the definition of this organization's governance domains with their communities and governance officers.


## Subject areas

Subject areas are topics or domains of knowledge that are of interest to the governance domains.  Some subject areas are common to multiple governance domains; others are specialized within a domain.  Each

## Governance Definitions

A *Governance Definition* is a metadata element that describes the context or purpose for an activity that supports the organization's operation. Figure 1 shows the main types of governance definition and how they link together to create a coherent response to a business strategy or regulation.

![Figure 1](traceability-from-business-drivers-to-action.svg)
> **Figure 1:** Using governance definitions to provide traceability from business drivers and regulations to actions.


## Governance classification, tagging and linking

One of the ways to reduce the cost of governance is to define groups of similar assets/resources along with the governance definitions that apply to members of the group.  This avoids having to make decisions on how to manage each asset/resource.  The cataloguing process just needs to work out which group(s) to place the asset in.  Labels such as classifications, and tags of different types are used to identify these group assignments.  When a governance process is operating on the asset/resource, it looks up the labels and follows the governance definitions for the group.

![Figure 4](divide-and-conquer-landscape.svg)
> **Figure 4:** Different types of tags used to group assets for governance

The different types of labels used to group assets/resources are used for different purposes and may indicate how official they are:

* [Governance Zones](/concepts/governance-zone) group assets according to their use.  They are typically is used for [controlling visibility to the resource's asset definition](/features/governance-zoning/overview).

* [Governance Classifications](#setting-up-the-levels-for-your-governance-classifications) define the groups used for specific types of governance.

    * Confidence Governance Classification defines the level of confidence that should be placed in the accuracy of related data items.  This limits the scope that the data can be used in.
    * Confidentiality Governance Classification defines the level of confidentiality or secrecy needed with particular data.
    * Criticality Governance Classification defines how critical the related resources are to the continued operation of the organization.
    * Impact Governance Classification defines how much of an impact a particular situation is to the operation of the organization.
    * Retention Governance Classification defines how long a resource (typically data) must be retained by the organization.

* License Types define the contract aka (terms and conditions) that define how the asset/resource can be used.

* Certification Types define specific characteristics of an asset/resource that has been verified for a particular span of time.

* [SecurityTags](/concepts/security-tags) identify labels and properties that are used in determining which data protection rules should be executed when particular data is requests. They can be attached to assets or schema elements depending on the scope of data that the security tags apply to. The synchronized access control feature describes how security tags are set up and used.

The labels may be assigned directly to the asset, or to elements, such as schemas and glossary terms that are linked to the asset.

## Setting up the levels for your governance classifications

The values used in governance classifications show the specific group that the classified asset belongs to.  Often an organization has their own levels defined and they can be set up in [`GovernanceClassificationLevel`](/types/4/0421-Governance-Classification-Levels/) definitions.

![Figure 5](governance-program-level-definition.svg)
> **Figure 5:** Governance classifications that use governance level definitions

Egeria has a set of default values that can be set up using the [`createStandardGovernanceClassificationLevels`](https://odpi.github.io/egeria/org/odpi/openmetadata/accessservices/governanceprogram/api/GovernanceClassificationLevelInterface.html) method.

## Measures and metrics

As important aspect of the governance program is the ability to measure its effectiveness and identify the assets that are delivering the highest value, or operating with the greatest efficiency etc.

A value that should be captured to demonstrate the effectiveness of the governance program is documented using the `GovernanceMetric` entity. It is linked to the appropriate governance definition and can be linked to a data set where the specific measurements are being gathered.

The calculation of governance metrics is often a summary of many other measurements associated with specific resources (such as data sources and processes) operating under the scope of the governance program. These resources are catalogued as [`Assets`](/concepts/asset). 

![Figure 6](governance-metrics-with-measurements-dataset.svg)
> **Figure 6:** Measuring governance through an external data set

The definition of their expected behavior or content can be captured using the `GovernanceExpectations` classification attached to the `Asset`. The measurements that support the assessment of a particular resource can be gathered and stored in a `GovernanceMeasurements` classification attached to its `Asset`.

![Figure 7](expectations-vs-measurements.svg)
> **Figure 7:** Setting expectations and gathering results in classifications

The measurement classification may be attached to a related element that describes an aspect for its operation.  For example, in figure 8 the measurement is attached to a process instance that captures a specific run of a process.  The expected values are attached to its parent process.

![Figure 8](expectations-vs-measurements-example.svg)
> **Figure 8:** Attaching the measurements to related elements


## Execution points

A governance execution point defines specific activity that is supporting governance.

There are three types:

* A Control Point is a place in the processing where a decision needs to be made. It may be a choice on whether to tolerate a reported situation or to resolve it - or it may be a decision on how to solve it.

* A Verification Point describes processing that is testing if a desired condition is true. Quality rules are examples of verification points. The result of a verification point is the output of the test. It may, for example, be a boolean, classification or a set of invalid values.

* An Enforcement Point describes processing that enforces an specific condition. For example, data may need to be encrypted at a certain point in the processing. The encryption processing is an enforcement point.

The ExecutionPointDefinition elements are created during the design of the governance program. They characterize the types of execution points that are needed to support the governance requirements. They are linked to the Governance Definition that they support using the ExecutionPointUse relationship. Typically the governance definitions linked to the governance execution point definitions are:

* Governance Processes
* Governance Procedures

Often execution points need to be integrated with the normal activity of the business, but they may also represent additional standalone activity.

The classifications ControlPoint, VerificationPoint and EnforcementPoint are used to label governance implementation elements with the type of execution point and the qualified name of the corresponding definition if any. They are often found on element such as:

* Governance Action Types
* Governance Actions

These classifications help in the review of the implementation of the governance program and can be used to drive additional audit logging.
