The dojo sessions are colour-coded like ski runs:

!!! beginner "Beginner session"

!!! intermediate "Intermediate session"

!!! advanced "Advanced session"

!!! expert "Expert session"

As you progress through the dojo, the colors of the sessions show how advanced your knowledge is becoming.  The later sections are not necessarily harder to understand, but they build on knowledge from earlier sections. 

The schedule also includes estimated times needed to complete each session.  Even though a dojo is styled as a "day of intense focus", there is a lot of information conveyed, and you may find it more profitable to only complete one session in each sitting.  Whichever way you choose to tackle the dojo, have fun and good luck - and do take breaks whenever you need to!
