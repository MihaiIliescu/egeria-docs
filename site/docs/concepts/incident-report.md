# Incident Report

An *incident report* describes a situation that is out of line with the governance definitions (such as policies and rules). It provides a focus point to coordinate efforts to resolve the situation.

As the incident is handled, details of the cause, affected resources and actions taken are attached to the incident report to create a complete record of the incident for future analysis.

Incident reports are typically created by [governance action services](/concepts/governance-action-service) or an external incident management tool.


## Open Metadata Types

The [0470 Incident Reporting](/types/4/0470-Incident-Reporting) model shows the structure of the incident report. It is a [`Referenceable`](/types/0/0010-Base-Model/#referenceable) so it can support comments and linked classifications and tags.
