# Comments

*Comments* are informal messages or feedback.  They can be attached to many places, for example

* an [asset](/concepts/asset),
* a [personal note](/concepts/personal-notes),
* a [community](/concepts/community), 
* a [community forum or community forum contribution](/concepts/community/#community-forum),
* a [review](/concepts/review),
* an [external reference](/concepts/external-reference),
* or another comment.

Sometimes specific names are used for comments depending on what they are attached to.  For example:

 * a *personal note comment* is a comment attached to a personal note.
 * a *forum comment* is a comment attached to a community forum either directly or via a community forum contribution.
 * a *comment reply* is a comment attached to another comment.  

The ability to reply to a comment (or a comment reply) means that comments can be chained together to show a detailed conversation on a topic.

The owner of a personal profile or the administrator of a community are able to remove inappropriate or out-of-date comments attached to their personal profile or community respectively.
