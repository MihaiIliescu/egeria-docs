# Javadoc

Javadoc is a tool that extracts specially formatted comments from java code and turns them into a documentation website.

Egeria uses javadoc extensively in its Java runtime.  The Javadoc website produced from the external API modules are published [at this url](https://odpi.github.io/egeria/index.html).  The site is regenerated each time the code changes via a pull request.
