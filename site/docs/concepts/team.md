# Teams

A team is a group of people who are working together to achieve a common goal.  The makeup of the team is defined using [Person Roles](/concepts/person-role) that define the different jobs within the team.  Some roles are defined as leadership roles and others are defined as team membership roles.  Individuals are then appointed to the roles.

## Organizations

Organization entities are specialized types of teams that represent the top of an organization - typically a separate legal entity.  The organization is then structured using a hierarchy of teams that describe how people are organized to achieve the objectives of the organization.
